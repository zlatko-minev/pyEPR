Automated Python module for the design and quantization of Josephson quantum circuits

Abstract: Superconducting circuits incorporating non-linear devices, such as Josephson
junctions and nanowires, are among the leading platforms for emerging quantum technologies.
Promising applications require designing and optimizing circuits with ever-increasing
complexity and controlling their dissipative and Hamiltonian parameters to several
significant digits. Therefore, there is a growing need for a systematic, simple, and robust
approach for precise circuit design, extensible to increased complexity.
The energy-participation ratio (EPR) approach presents such an approach to unify the design
of dissipation and Hamiltonians around a single concept — the energy participation, a number
between zero and one — in a single-step electromagnetic simulation. This markedly reduces
the required number of simulations and allows for robust extension to complex systems.
The approach is general purpose, derived ab initio, and valid for arbitrary non-linear
devices and circuit architectures. Experimental results on a variety of circuit quantum
electrodynamics (cQED) devices and architectures, 3D and flip-chip (2.5D), have been
demonstrated to exhibit ten percent to percent-level agreement for non-linear coupling
and modal Hamiltonian parameters over five-orders of magnitude and across a dozen samples.

Here, in this package, all routines of the EPR approach are fully automated.
An interface with ansys is provided.
Automated analysis of lumped and distributed circuits is provided.
